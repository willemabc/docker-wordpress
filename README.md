# docker-wordpress

My recipe for a Docker workflow for local WordPress development.

After cloning this repository, navigate to the directory you cloned this to and run:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

In your directory you will now find a new subdirectory called *wp-content*.

Just one more step: visit http://localhost in your browser and run the famous 5-minute install!
